Educating Young Eyes(Vision-Therapy-System)
=====================
Introduction
Binocular vision is the ability to use both eyes to capture images in visual space and the ability of the brain to compare and fuse the images from the two eyes into one clear image. When the brain’s visual processing isn’t optimal, it is unable to produce a clear image, and the individual is said to have binocular vision dysfunctions or binocular vision problems.
American Optometric Association say that nearly 25% of school age children in USA have vision problems and 60% of students who struggle with reading have one or other underlying vision problems. Parents and teachers are often unaware of the correlation between optimum visual performance, health and child development. Often time children who complain of unwillingness to read or lack of concentration in class are either considered to be lazy or misdiagnosed as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Symptoms like headaches, eye aches, poor reading comprehension, reversing letters while reading, dislike of 3-D movies, sensitivity to light and blurred vision, etc. usually indicate the presence of binocular vision problems. 
Reading and learning becomes a challenge for those with vision problems since both eyes are not teaming to work together properly causing them to drop out of school. Such children are frequently placed in special education programs.  Hence it is very important to have vision screening to identify the children at the risk of vision problems and provide treatments. Hence there is a strong need for vision screening.

EYE Application
The EYE Application will bridge the gap of the existing systems deficiencies. 
EYE is a software application designed to detect and aid in the treatment of binocular vision issues in children. This application is a suite of various tools, consisting of:
1. Screening tools to help medical providers to conduct vision tests. 
2. Database to record the results with the ability to share among medical providers.
3. Therapy games to aid in the treatment of vision issues.
4. Parental portal to track the treatment of vision issues for their children. 
The application is also designed to be a Knowledge management system to aid in the research of vision issues by the larger medical community.
